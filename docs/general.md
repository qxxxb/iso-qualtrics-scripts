# General

This documentation contains information not just about the scripts in this
repository, but also about the survey as a whole.

Currently the documentation only consists of the loose markdown files in this
repository located in `docs/`.

For detailed instructions on how to create the next year's survey, see
`docs/walkthrough.md`. Note that because it is intended to be read by next
year's survey developer, when it refers to "the previous year's survey," it is
referring to what the rest of the documentation refers to as the "current
survey".

### Notes

- "Immigration Regulations Session" was renamed to "9 Tools for International
  Student Success." However, I did not rename places that would not be publicly
  visible (e.g. embedded data labels, filenames).
