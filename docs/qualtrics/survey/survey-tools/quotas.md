# Quotas

Quotas are used so that the scripts can calculate occupancies at
events. They are not used for limiting the number of participants (overflow
should handled by the scripts).

### Notes

- You will most likely have to refresh the survey page in order to see the
  quotas update after completing the survey in preview mode. Alternatively, you
  could use the public quota dashboard.
